# Weather-App

With this project, the objective was to create a functional weather app. There are a few different attributes to this application. The first is being able to enter in your desired city of choice. When selected you are presented with the current weather of that city, along with a 5 day forcast. The citys are all saved locally so even if you refresh or close the page, your favorite cities will be there.

### Apis

This application uses two seperate api calls from the https://openweathermap.org/ apis. The first call gives you your current weather forcast. The second pulls the information future forcasts as well as the uv index information.
